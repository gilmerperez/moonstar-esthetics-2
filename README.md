# Moonstar Esthetics

## Description

Moonstar Esthetics is a modern, responsive web application built to showcase the full range of skincare, laser/IPL, and waxing services offered by Moonstar Esthetics. It addresses the common problem of outdated or hard-to-navigate websites in the beauty industry by providing a professional, user-friendly online presence that highlights the quality and breadth of services.

- **Problem:** Many beauty and esthetics businesses struggle with outdated websites that fail to effectively communicate their services, pricing, and value proposition to potential clients. This creates barriers to client engagement and business growth.

- **Solution:** Moonstar Esthetics provides a comprehensive, modern web platform that clearly presents all services with detailed descriptions, pricing, and duration information. The site features intuitive navigation, client testimonials, and seamless booking integration, making it easy for clients to discover and book services.

- **Methodology:** Built with Next.js using the App Router architecture, the application follows a component-based design pattern with server-side rendering for optimal SEO and performance. The site uses CSS Modules for scoped styling, JSON for structured data management, and implements client-side interactivity where needed while maintaining fast initial page loads through Next.js optimizations.
